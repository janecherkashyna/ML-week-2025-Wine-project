# Project Setup Instructions

To set up and run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository** Copy the project to your local directory by running the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/janecherkashyna/ML-week-2025-Wine-project.git
   ```

   Replace `<repository-url>` with the actual URL of the repository.

2. **Use Python 3.10** Ensure you have Python 3.10 installed on your system. You can verify this by running:

   ```bash
   python --version
   ```

   If Python 3.10 is not installed, download and install it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

3. **Install Dependencies** Navigate to the project directory and install all the required dependencies using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

Now your environment is ready to run the project.
